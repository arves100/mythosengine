  Notes by: Dan Higdon
  Updated: March 9, 1998

  Changes for this release --------------------------------------------------

    o Updated copyrights

    Note: It seems that Visual C++ V5.0 handling of stack variables
          prevents the workaround for use under Windows 9x/NT from operating
	  correctly. Therefore, we no longer recommend using Bozo in your
	  applications.


  Future notes --------------------------------------------------------------

  This library will be dropped in a future release of MythOS due to the
  many problems with allocating client stacks within the Windows environment.
