                            _Library Status_

  Notes by:  Tim Little
  Updated:   October 13, 1998

  Changes for this release --------------------------------------------------

    o Added VngoColor24bit::compress24() to convert to internal 24 bit
      color format.

    o Added check for VNGO_COLOR_24BIT flag to frect() and pixel() in
      the 16 bpp and D3D viewports to allow direct use of 24-bit RGB
      values.

    o get_RGB() for the VngoPal structures now check for the VNGO_COLOR_
      bits and perform appropriately.  Mostly changed for safety as we
      add checks for the VNGO_COLOR_ flags to more functions.

    o The screen manager check_mode() functions need to be implemented.


 Future notes ---------------------------------------------------------------

 This library and all associated tools will be retired in a future release
 of MythOS and replaced with an entirely new 2D/3D pipeline.
